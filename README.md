# MeshViewer
3D graphics application for importing, viewing, and interacting with 3D models of various formats.

This application is written in C++ and uses the OpenGL (opengl 3.3) API. It is also my first computer graphics project that I built from scratch. C++ is highly optimizable and perfect for getting the best performance out of our computer hardware. OpenGL is very easy to use and allows our application to maintain a simplistic architecture relative to its function.
